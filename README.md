🎬 Project 1: Movie Recommendation System
🧠 1. One-line Overview
“I built a movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on user-selected preferences using content-based filtering.”

🔍 2. Problem it Solves
“Users often struggle to find what to watch next. This system helps them get personalized recommendations based on the movie they already like.”

⚙️ 3. Tech Stack
“It’s built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data processing and model building. The frontend was done using Streamlit for quick web deployment.”

💡 4. Key Features
Suggests top 5–10 similar movies

Uses cosine similarity on genre, director, and keywords

Integrated with TMDB API to show movie posters

Simple and responsive UI

🧩 5. Role and Challenges
“I designed the recommendation logic using vector similarity and feature engineering. The main challenge was selecting the right features and normalizing the data for better similarity scoring.”

🚀 6. Outcome / Future Scope
“It was a great learning experience in data science and deploying ML models. I plan to extend it using collaborative filtering or deep learning for better personalization.”
